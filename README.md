# hello-world

Old programmers never die, they just code away.  That's me.  Started out on 1401s and it's been fun ever since.
Working on a program I call Playlist Tools.  It reads and stores iTunes library XML files.  It compares librarys.
It's a learning tool for me.  Right now I am working with WAMP, javascript, and jQuery.
